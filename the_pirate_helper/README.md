# The Pirate Helper

Embeds search results from The Pirate Bay and Stream link (when available)
into iMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TVMuse. Cleans up The Pirate Bay
a little. Now has an options menu for configuring the url and protocol of The Pirate Bay.

If you guys have any suggestions or anything let me know, I don't really know what else to do with it.

## Tips

* Works best in combination with the [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/en/) browser add-on and the [Anti-AdBlock Killer](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/155840) UserScript by [reek](http://userscripts.org/users/reek)
* You can click the magnet icon below the movie name to download the first torrent on the list
* You can download the video directly from WatchFreeInHD if you have Direct Video Link checked in the options. Just right click the player and select 'Save Video As...' in Firefox or 'Save As...' in Chrome.

## Features

* Options menu to set The Pirate Bay URL/IP and protocol.
* Works well with Chrome and Firefox.
* Automatically checks for updates daily, so you will always have the latest version.
* Makes search form order by seeds highest to lowest by default on The Pirate Bay
* Auto removes torrents with 0 seeds on The Pirate Bay
* Random UI Tweaks on The Pirate Bay
* Adds Magnet and Stream links to iMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TVMuse

## About the Author

I am an aspiring programmer, who has never worked professionally in the field. The only reward I get for this is the satisfaction of seeing good reviews on my work. It would mean a lot to me if you took a second to tell me what you think, and even make a suggestion, if you have one.

## Planned Updates

* More in-depth options menu for better control of what the script does.
