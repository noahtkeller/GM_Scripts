# The Pirate Helper

Embeds search results from The Pirate Bay and Stream link (when available)
into iMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and TVMuse. Cleans up The Pirate Bay
a little. Now has an options menu for configuring the url and protocol of The Pirate Bay.

If you guys have any suggestions or anything let me know, I don't really know what else to do with it.

## Tips
* You can click the magnet icon below the movie name to download the first torrent on the list
* You can set the 'TPB Address' option to an IP or URL.
* You can select HTTP/HTTPS protocol for TPB in the options menu.
